# Practice - Part 1 and Part 2

## Overview
Practical exercises and coding problems for Python fundamentals, covering Part 1 (beginner topics) and Part 2 (intermediate topics). These files contain hands-on practice to reinforce core concepts.

## What I Learned
- **Variables and Data Types**: Working with different Python data types (int, float, str, bool)
- **Control Flow**: Understanding if-else statements, loops (for, while), and conditional logic
- **Input/Output**: Working with user input and output using `input()` and `print()`
- **String Operations**: String manipulation, formatting, and methods
- **Basic Algorithms**: Implementing simple algorithms and problem-solving approaches
- **Debugging**: Identifying and fixing common errors

## Main Concepts
- Sequential execution and control structures
- Problem decomposition and solution design
- Testing and validation
- Code readability and best practices
- Iterative improvement
